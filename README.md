# Weather-App

A mobile friendly weather application.
The user can enter any city name in the search box. The application will automatically search (without reloading) for the city's weather information using OpenWeatherMap API. 

Information includes: 
- current temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit)
- weather condition
- wind condition
- wind speed
- wind direction
- humidity
- 5 day forecast
- 3 hour forecast

The background will change based on the city's weather.
The user has a choice of viewing the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

This application is responsive (using Bootstrap) and asynchronous (using AJAX). Weather data is in XML format.

**Note:** The  OpenWeatherMap API Key is removed from the code.

**Live Demo:** Link is protected. Message me for login info.
